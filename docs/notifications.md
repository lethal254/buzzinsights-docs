# Notifications & Alerts

BuzzInsights keeps you in the loop by surfacing the most critical signals—right when you need them.

Stay informed through **email** and **web push notifications**, with fully customizable triggers that help your team catch issues early, track sentiment changes, and respond faster to user needs.

## 🔧 Configurable Triggers

You can fine-tune your alerts to match your product's rhythm. Here’s a breakdown of the available triggers:

- **Time Window**  
  Compare current feedback activity with a previous time window to detect sudden spikes or drops.

- **Monitoring Period**  
  Send recurring reports after a specified time interval—ideal for keeping track without checking the dashboard constantly.

- **Issue Threshold**  
  Get notified when a specific number of users mention the same issue—great for spotting common pain points or bugs.

- **Volume Multiplier**  
  Trigger alerts when feedback volume exceeds a set multiple of your baseline traffic.

- **Volume Increase Multiplier**  
  Alert based on raw count increases over short windows—helpful for catching early momentum or sudden influxes.

- **Sentiment Threshold**  
  Set thresholds between 0–4 to detect and react to negative sentiment trends.

- **Comment Growth**  
  Monitor when a post or discussion sees a sharp increase in comments, which may indicate rising user interest or frustration.

## ✉️ Where Notifications Are Sent

Currently, BuzzInsights supports:

- **Email alerts** — Sent directly to configured email addresses.
- **Web push notifications** — Delivered in-browser while you're logged in.

You can configure one or multiple recipients, and set different thresholds depending on how closely your team wants to monitor incoming feedback.

> ⚙️ _Tip: If you haven’t set custom thresholds, BuzzInsights will apply sensible defaults so you don’t miss anything critical._
